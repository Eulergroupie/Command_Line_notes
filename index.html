        <h1>Codecademy Learn the Command Line</h1>
            <p>The <em>command line</em> is a text interface for the computer's operating system. To access the command line, we use
             the terminal. From the command line, you can navigate through files and directories (folders) on your computer.<br>
            A <em>filesystem</em> organizes a computer's files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the <em>
                root directory</em>. Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

            <h2>Navigating the File System</h2>
                <p>We will focus on Unix-based systems.<br>
                    Five common commands:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>pwd</strong> "Print Working Directory" outputs the name of the current working directory</li>
                        <li><strong>ls</strong> lists all files and directories in the working directory</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>option <strong>-a</strong> shows all files and directories including hidden ones (start with a dot)</li> 
                            <li>option <strong>-l</strong> shows a long list with 7 columns of information</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>access rights: rules that govern read, write, and execute</li>
                                <li>hard links: number of child directories and files</li>
                                <li>owner's username</li>
                                <li>owner's group</li>
                                <li>file size</li>
                                <li>date & time modified</li>
                                <li>file or directory name</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>option <strong>-t</strong> shows a list sorted by the time and date last modified</li>
                            <li>option <strong>-alt</strong> shows all of the above at once</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>cd <em>pathname</em></strong> switches you into the directory you specify</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>.</strong> is a special directory name that means "this directory"</li>
                            <li><strong>..</strong> is a special directory name that means "one directory up"</li>
                            <li><strong>~</strong> is a special directory name that means "home" (i.e. where your stuff begins)</li>
                            <li><strong>/</strong> is a special directory name that means "root" (i.e. the top of the file system)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li><strong>mkdir <em>directory_name</em></strong> creates a new directory in the working directory</li>
                        <li><strong>touch <em>filename</em></strong> creates a new file inside the working directory</li>
                    </ul>
                    When a file, directory or program is passed into a command, it is called an <em>argument</em>.<br>
                    <em>Options</em> are dashed letters that follow a command and modify its behavior.<br>
                </p>
            <h2>Viewing and Changing the File System</h2>
                <p>We can also use the command line to copy, move, and remove files and directories.
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>cp <em>source(s) destination</em></strong> copies files</li>
                        <li><strong>mv <em>source(s) destination</em></strong> moves and renames files</li>
                        <li><strong>rm <em>filename</em></strong> removes files</li>
                        <ul> 
                            <li>option <strong>-r</strong> recursively removes directories that are not empty</li>
                            <li>option <strong>-f</strong> forces the remove without prompting if read-only</li> 
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Often wildcards like * (meaning any number of any characters) can be used in place of, or combined with filenames<br>    
                </p>
            <h2>Redirecting Input and Output</h2>
                <p>Through redirection you can direct the input and output of a command to and from other files and programs, and
                 chain commands together in a pipeline.</p>
                <p>Typing <strong>echo "<em>Hello</em>"</strong> accepts the string Hello as standard input and redirects it to
                 standard output. Here is some information about standard streams:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Standard input or <em>stdin</em> is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input
                     device</li>
                    <li>Standard output or <em>stdout</em> is the information outputted after a process is run</li>
                    <li>Standard error or <em>stderr</em> is an error message outputted by a failed process</li>
                </ol>
                Redirection reroutes standard input, standard output, and standard error to or from a different location.</p>
                <p>Some more useful commands for manipulating text:
                <ul>
                    <li>Typing <strong>cat <em>filename</em></strong> outputs the contents of a file to the terminal (stdout).</li>
                    <li>Typing <strong>wc <em>filename</em></strong> will return the number of newlines (lines), words, and bytes
                     (characters) in a file.</li>
                    <li>Typing <strong>sort <em>filename</em></strong> orders a file alphabetically for the standard output.</li>
                    <li>Typing <strong>uniq <em>filename</em></strong> filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file.</li>
                    <li>Typing <strong>head <em>filename</em></strong> outputs the first 10 lines of a file.</li>
                    <li>Typing <strong>grep <em>pattern filename</em></strong> searches files for lines that match a pattern and 
                     returns the results. The pattern may be a basic regular expression. e.g. <strong>grep Mount
                     mountains.txt</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Option <strong>-i</strong> enables the command to ignore case.</li>
                        <li>Option <strong>-R</strong> enables the command to recursively search directories, returning filenames
                         and the matching text.</li>
                        <li>Option <strong>-l</strong> enables the command to return the first filename with a match. Combined with 
                         <strong>-R</strong>, multiple filenames may be returned.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Typing <strong>sed <em>pattern_string filename</em></strong> calls the stream editor to search a file and 
                     replace word(s) found according to the pattern_string. e.g. <strong>sed 's/snow/rain/' forests.txt</strong> 
                     would replace the first instance of snow in the file forests.txt with the word rain. 's' stands for substitution.
                     When 'g' (for global) is added to the end of the pattern, all instances are replaced. e.g. <strong>
                     sed 's/snow/rain/g' forests.txt</strong></li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>The following are the standard redirect commands:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <strong>&gt</strong> command redirects the standard output to a file, either creating it if it doesn't exist 
                     or writing over it.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>&gt&gt</strong> command redirects the standard output to append a file.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>&lt</strong> command redirects output from a command on the right to be input for the command on the
                     left.</li>
                    <li>The <strong>|</strong> is called a pipe and it redirects the output from a command on the left and pipes it in
                     as input to the command on the right. Piped commands can also be chained together. e.g.
                     <strong>cat volcanoes.txt | wc | cat &gt islands.txt</strong></li>
                </ul></p>
